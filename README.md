# Play Vision

## A Matlab library for feature detection, image matching, Optical Flow, Structure from Motion, Epipolar Geometry and 3D recostruction.

### Description
Libray for Computer Vision manipulation, in the main folder there is the main code to costruct a 3D model given a sequence of image of one object.
In the step by step folder there are different short program to perform isolated manipulation. The 3D recostruction use almost all of them.

### Installation
To install the library simply clone the master branch on your computer, then in MATLAB add the main folder to the paths, along with the helpers subfolder.

### An Visult 3D example
To run an example simple run the Main_3D.m to get the 3D ricostruction of the example of castel, Further try to select, create and import imagine in a new folder and select it on the Main_3D.m script to get the 3d ricostruction of the image.
